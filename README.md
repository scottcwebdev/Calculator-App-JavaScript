JavaScript Calculator
=========================
Front-end calculator made with vanilla JavaScript.

This project had lots of mini challenges in which I had to dig deep to overcome.  For example, if a user enters multiple decimals (i.e. 1..5.1); how can I limit the input to only the first occurance (i.e. 1.51)? What if a user enters multiple operators in a row; how should I handle that? These difficulties as well as many others often seemed insurmountable at the onset, but with a little patience and grit I eventually figured it out.

I purposely chose to stick with vanilla JavaScript and not rely on libraries or frameworks such as jQuery or React. While these tools are in hot demand, my goal is to first have a strong base foundation with the language. I believe this project has made a big contribution to accomplishing that goal.
